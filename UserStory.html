                    <dt>RICH DAD POOR DAD</dt>
                    <dd>Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, had two main influential fathers in his life. 
                        Poor Dad was Kiyosaki’s biological father, a man who was highly intelligent and very well educated. Poor Dad believed in studying hard and getting good grades, then finding a well-paying job. Yet, despite these seemingly positive attributes, Poor Dad didn’t do well financially.
                        Rich Dad was the father of Kiyosaki’s best friend. He had a similar work ethic to Kiyosaki’s real dad, but with a twist. Rich Dad believed in financial education, learning how money works, and understanding how to make money work for you. Although he was an eighth-grade dropout, Rich Dad eventually became a millionaire by putting the power of money to work for him.
                        The book is written from Kiyosaki’s perspective of how Rich Dad went about making money and the mistakes that Poor Dad made. The first six chapters of Rich Dad Poor Dad make up about two-thirds of the book and discuss the six lessons that Kiyosaki learned from his Rich Dad.

                    <dt>CASHFLOW QUADRANT</dt>
                    <dd>The Cashflow Quadrant will explain why some people can work less, yet earn more. This ability is the difference between employees and business owners. It reveals why certain investors are successful, and while others are not. Plus, it focuses on how some of the brightest graduates end up working for college dropouts. The Cashflow Quadrant reveals why some people can make lots of money, and others are not. 
                        The Cashflow Quadrant is a simple model designed by Robert Kiyosaki. It shows that there are four different paths to becoming wealthy. Importantly, some of these four paths are more efficient. 
                        The quadrant that you belong to depends on where most of your income comes from. Either you are an employee (E), a small business owner or self-employed (S), a big business owner (B), or an investor (I). An E works for the system. An S is the system. A B creates, owns, and controls the system. An I invests money into the system.

                    <dt>GUIDE TO INVESTING</dt>
                    <dd>Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the famous book, “Rich dad, poor dad”, has written a book named “Guide to investing”, which helps you build the right attitude to help you become rich. The book starts with a young Robert going to meet his mentor, whom he calls ‘rich dad’, and rich dad’s son. They are talking about investing in a very lucrative opportunity. While Robert asks to join in, the two politely respond to him that he couldn’t do it, since the opportunity was legally only for the ‘officially rich’, i.e. a networth of $1,000,000 and above. Stung by the incident, Robert consults his one and only guide on how to grow rich – his rich dad. The book is a culmination of what rich dad taught Robert about getting rich.
